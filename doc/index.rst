#####################################
Welcome to PMbrowser's documentation!
#####################################

:program:`PMbrowser` is open-source software aimed at electrophysiologists who use :program:`PATCHMASTER` or
:program:`PATCHMASTER NEXT` from `HEKA <http://www.heka.com/downloads/downloads_main.html#down_patchmaster_next>`_ and
:program:`IgorPro` of `WaveMetrics <https://www.wavemetrics.com/>`_. It can open bundled data files (:file:`.dat`) and 
export :program:`IgorPro` compatible files (see :ref:`intro-label` for details).
But even if you do not use :program:`IgorPro`, you might find :program:`PMbrowser` helpful.
